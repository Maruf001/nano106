NANO106
=======

Welcome to the repo for NANO106. 

NANO106 is UCSD's course on Crystallography of Materials taught by Prof Shyue Ping Ong. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a persistent and evolving collection of supplementary course materials that illustrate various symmetry and crystallography concepts and computations. Most of the code are written in python and presented in ipython notebooks. Some static material may be created in LaTeX.

While this repo is completely open and anyone is welcome to use the materials contain therein, I would ask that you acknowledge any usage.
